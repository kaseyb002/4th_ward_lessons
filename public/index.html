        <p class="question">Q: What are some of the consequences of repeatedly breaking our covenants?</p>

        <p class="question">Q: Why would the Lord command us to make covenants when we are not capable of perfectly keeping those covenants?</p>

        <p>From talk:</p>
        <p class="verse">After attending The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for 39 years, John was baptized in 2015. A year later, John and Bonnie were sealed in the Memphis Tennessee Temple, 20 years after she had received her own endowment. Their 47-year-old son, Robert, said of his dad, “Dad has really, really blossomed since he received the priesthood.” Bonnie added, “John has always been a happy and cheerful person, but receiving the ordinances and honoring his covenants has enhanced his gentleness.”</p>

        <p class="question">Q: How do your covenants affect your everyday life?</p>

        <h2>Section 3</h2>

        <p>From talk:</p>

        <p class="verse">in 1842, the Prophet Joseph Smith administered the endowment to a limited number of men and women. Mercy Fielding Thompson was one of them. The Prophet said to her, “This [endowment] will bring you out of darkness into marvelous light.</p>

        <p class="question">Q: How do the ordinances bring light into our lives?</p>

        <p>D&C 84:20</p>

        <p class="verse">20 Therefore, in the ordinances thereof, the power of godliness is manifest.</p>

        <p class="question">Without being too specific about what happens in the temple, how do we learn to become like God in the temple ordinances?</p>

        <p>From talk:</p>

        <p class="verse">We must also, in President Russell M. Nelson’s words, “<b>keep</b> on the covenant path.” President Nelson continued, “Your commitment to follow the Savior by making covenants with Him and then <b>keeping</b> those covenants will open the door to every spiritual blessing and privilege available to men, women, and children everywhere.”</p>

        <p class="question">Q: What does it mean to keep your covenants? Is it just holding a temple recommend?</p>
