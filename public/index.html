        <p><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2017/10/the-needs-before-us?lang=eng">Talk given by Elder Renlund - Oct 2017 General Conference</a></p>

        <p>From talk:</p>

        <p class="verse">I would like to compare the priesthood . . . to a rocket . . . and the Savior’s atoning power to the payload that a rocket delivers.</p>

        <h4 class="top-baby-buffer">Helping others find forgiveness</h4>

        <p>From talk:</p>

        <p class="verse">He offers forgiveness of sins, conditioned on obedience to the laws and ordinances of His gospel.</p>

        <p>From talk:</p>

        <p class="verse">I came to understand more fully the relationship between the “priesthood” rocket and the “opportunity to benefit from Christ’s atoning power” payload several years ago. During a weekend, I had two assignments. One was to create the first stake in a country, and the other was to interview a young man and, if all was in order, restore his priesthood and temple blessings. This 30-year-old man had joined the Church in his late teens. He served an honorable mission. But when he returned home, he lost his way, and he lost his membership in the Church. After some years, “he came to himself,” and with the help of loving priesthood leaders and kind members, he repented and was readmitted by baptism into the Church.</p>

        <p class="verse">Later, he applied to have his priesthood and temple blessings restored. We set an appointment for Saturday at 10:00 a.m. at the meetinghouse. When I arrived for the earlier interviews, he was already there. He was so anxious to have the priesthood once again, he just could not wait.</p>

        <p class="verse">During our interview, I showed him the letter explaining that President Thomas S. Monson had personally reviewed his application and authorized the interview. This otherwise stoic young man wept. I then told him that the date of our interview would have no official meaning in his life. He looked puzzled. I informed him that after I restored his blessings, his membership record would show only his original baptism, confirmation, priesthood ordination, and endowment dates. He choked up again.</p>

        <p class="verse">I asked him to read from the Doctrine and Covenants:</p>

        <p class="verse">“Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more.</p>

        <p class="verse">“By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins—behold, he will confess them and forsake them.”</p>

        <p class="verse">Tears filled his eyes a third time. Then I placed my hands on his head, and in the name of Jesus Christ and by the authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood, and with the authorization of the President of the Church, I restored his priesthood and temple blessings.</p>

        <p class="verse">The joy that came over us was profound. He knew he was once again authorized to hold and exercise the priesthood of God. He knew that his temple blessings were again fully operative. He had a bounce in his step and a radiant light about him. I was so proud of him, and I sensed how proud Heavenly Father was of him too.</p>

        <p class="question">Q: How did Elder Renlund use the Priesthood to help this man find forigiveness?</p>

        <p class="question">Q: How do we help our family members find forgiveness for their sins?</p>

        <h4 class="top-baby-buffer">"Being casual or apathetic"</h4>

        <p>From talk:</p>

        <p class="verse">Severe consequences result from breaking priesthood covenants and altogether turning from them. Being casual or apathetic in a priesthood calling is like introducing material fatigue into a rocket component. It jeopardizes the priesthood covenant because it can lead to mission failure. Disobedience to God’s commandments breaks the covenant. For a perpetual, unrepentant covenant-breaker, the promised blessings are withdrawn.</p>

        <p class="question">Q: What parts of our covenant are easy to be casual about?</p>

        <p class="question">Q: Why do you think casually keeping our covenants make us less effective in delivering the payload?</p>

        <p>What we commit to do when we covenant:</p>

        <p class="verse">A Melchizedek Priesthood holder covenants to fulfill the responsibilities associated with the Aaronic Priesthood and to magnify his calling in the Melchizedek Priesthood. He does so by keeping the commandments associated with the covenant. These commandments include giving “diligent heed to the words of eternal life” by living by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God, bearing testimony of Jesus Christ and His latter-day work, not boasting of himself, and becoming the Savior’s friend, trusting Him as a friend would.</p>

        <hr />

        <p>From talk:</p>

        <p class="verse">When a man makes a covenant, he is holding himself, like water, in his cupped hands. And if he opens his fingers, he need not hope to find himself again. A covenant-breaker no longer has a self to commit or a guarantee to offer.</p>

        <p class="question">Q: Why is it a big deal to commit to something as serious as the Melchizedek Priesthood, and then not live up to that commitment?</p>

        <h4 class="top-baby-buffer">"That every man might speak in the name of God"</h4>

        <p><a href="https://www.lds.org/broadcasts/article/worldwide-leadership-training/2012/01/priesthood-power-in-the-home?lang=eng">2012 Church Broadcast with Pres. Packer:</a></p>

        <p class="verse">There is one phrase in that revelation that changed the work of the Church, and if they will, changed the work of the Christian churches forever. That was simply “that every man might speak in the name of God the Lord, even the Savior of the world” (D&C 1:20).</p>

        <p class="verse">To imagine putting together a church where the authority of the priesthood was to be given to every worthy adult male would seem like a very reckless, dangerous thing, but that is the way it is.</p>

        <p class="question">Q: Why give that power and authority to guys like us? Why not keep it strictly with the Apostles and other Church leadership?</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.lds.org/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-13-the-priesthood?lang=eng">Priesthood - Chapter 13 of Gospel Principles Manual</a></p>

        <p class="verse">The priesthood is the eternal power and authority of God. Through the priesthood He created and governs the heavens and the earth. By this power the universe is kept in perfect order.</p>

        <p class="question">Q: What exactly is the power of the Priesthood? What do you think is the source of that power?</p>
