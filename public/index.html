        <p>From talk:</p>

        <p class="verse">Participating in ordinances and honoring the associated covenants will bring you marvelous light and protection in this ever-darkening world.</p>

        <h2>Section 1</h2>

        <p class="question">Q: What are we committing to do when we make covenants with God?</p>

        <p class="question">Q: What blessings does God promise?</p>

        <p>From talk: (Section Header: The Atonement of Christ and His Example)</p>

        <p class="verse">After the Savior received the ordinance of baptism to “fulfil all righteousness” (see 2 Nephi 31:5–6), Satan tempted Him. Likewise, our temptations do not end after baptism or sealing, but receiving the sacred ordinances and honoring the associated covenants fill us with marvelous light and give us strength to resist and overcome temptations.</p>

        <p class="question">Q: Given that we're promised these blessings, why is it difficult sometimes to keep our covenants?</p>

        <p class="question">Q: How can we remember what's at stake?</p>

        <h2>Section 2</h2>

        <p class="question">Q: What are some of the blessings that come from keeping your ordinary, everyday commitments?</p>

        <p class="question">Q: How are temple covenants different than commitments we make with other people, or with ourselves?</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2017/10/the-priesthood-and-the-saviors-atoning-power?lang=eng#p11">From talk given by Elder Renlund in October 2017:</a></p>

        <p class="verse">
          He makes an identity between the truth of the promise and his own virtue. When a man makes a covenant, he is holding himself, like water, in his cupped hands. And if he opens his fingers, he need not hope to find himself again. A covenant-breaker no longer has a self to commit or a guarantee to offer.</p>

        <p class="question">Q: Why does it matter have a "self to commit or a guarantee to offer"?</p>

        <h2>Section 3</h2>

        <p>From talk: (Section Header: Ordinances and Covenants)</p>

        <p class="verse">After attending The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for 39 years, John was baptized in 2015. A year later, John and Bonnie were sealed in the Memphis Tennessee Temple, 20 years after she had received her own endowment. Their 47-year-old son, Robert, said of his dad, “Dad has really, really blossomed since he received the priesthood.” Bonnie added, “John has always been a happy and cheerful person, but receiving the ordinances and honoring his covenants has enhanced his gentleness.”</p>

        <p class="question">Q: How do your covenants affect your everyday life?</p>

        <h2>Section 4</h2>

        <p>From talk: (Beginning Section)</p>

        <p class="verse">in 1842, the Prophet Joseph Smith administered the endowment to a limited number of men and women. Mercy Fielding Thompson was one of them. The Prophet said to her, “This [endowment] will bring you out of darkness into marvelous light.</p>

        <p class="question">Q: How do the ordinances bring light into our lives?</p>

        <p>D&C 84:20</p>

        <p class="verse">20 Therefore, in the ordinances thereof, the power of godliness is manifest.</p>

        <p class="question">Q: Without being too specific about what happens in the temple, what do we learn about the "power of godliness" in the temple ordinances?</p>

        <p>From talk: (Section Header: Ordinances and Covenants)</p>

        <p class="verse">We must also, in President Russell M. Nelson’s words, “<b>keep</b> on the covenant path.” President Nelson continued, “Your commitment to follow the Savior by making covenants with Him and then <b>keeping</b> those covenants will open the door to every spiritual blessing and privilege available to men, women, and children everywhere.”</p>

        <p class="question">Q: What does it mean to keep your covenants?</p>
