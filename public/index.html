          <p><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2017/10/the-needs-before-us?lang=eng">Talk given by Sis. Bonnie Oscarson</a></p>

          <p>From talk:</p>

          <p class="verse">I have tremendous love for and faith in those of you who are in your teen and young adult years. I have seen and felt of your desires to serve and make a difference in the world. I believe that most members consider service to be at the heart of their covenants and discipleship. But I also think that sometimes it’s easy to miss some of the greatest opportunities to serve others because we are distracted or because we are looking for ambitious ways to change the world and we don’t see that some of the most significant needs we can meet are within our own families, among our friends, in our wards, and in our communities. We are touched when we see the suffering and great needs of those halfway around the world, but we may fail to see there is a person who needs our friendship sitting right next to us in class.</p>

          <p class="verse">Sister Linda K. Burton told the story of a stake Relief Society president who, working with others, collected quilts for people in need during the 1990s. “She and her daughter drove a truck filled with those quilts from London to Kosovo. On her journey home she received an unmistakable spiritual impression that sank deep into her heart. The impression was this: ‘What you have done is a very good thing. Now go home, walk across the street, and serve your neighbor!’”</p>

          <p class="question">Q: Why do you think people sometimes would prefer to help those in Africa or Kosovo, rather than focusing on those closer to home?</p>

          <hr />

          <p class="verse">What good does it do to save the world if we neglect the needs of those closest to us and those whom we love the most? How much value is there in fixing the world if the people around us are falling apart and we don’t notice? Heavenly Father may have placed those who need us closest to us, knowing that we are best suited to meet their needs.</p>

          <p class="question">Q: Why are we best suited to meet their needs?</p>

          <hr />

          <p class="verse"><b>Begin</b> your service in your own homes and within your own families. These are the relationships that can be eternal. Even if—and maybe especially if—your family situation is less than perfect, you can find ways to serve, lift, and strengthen. Begin where you are, love them as they are, and prepare for the family you want to have in the future.</p>

          <p class="question">Q: Notice how she says to <u>begin</u> your service in your home. Why might it be better to focus on serving inside your home first before serving outside of your home?</p> 

          <p class="question">Q: How do you serve your family members?</p>

          <p class="question">Q: What makes it challenging to serve more in your home?</p>

          <p>To see how we can serve those closest to us, we are going to look at how Lehi and Nephi served their family.</p>

          <h4>Leading</h4>

          <p><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.12?lang=eng#12">1 Nephi 8:12</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.13-15?lang=eng#13">1 Nephi 8:13-15</a> - Tree of Life</p>

          <p>Lehi made the journey to the Tree of Life and tasted the fruit. And it brought him a lot of joy, to the point where he wanted to share it with his family.</p>

          <p class="question">Q: Are the Gospel and the Church like a sweet tasting fruit to you? Do you feel a deep desire to share it with your family?</p>

          <p class="question">Q: If not, how do you develop that desire?</p>

          <p class="question">Q: What's sweet about the Gospel?</p>

          <h2 class="top-baby-buffer">Serving at Church</h2>
          
          <p>From talk:</p>

          <p class="verse">It is true that we attend our weekly Church meetings to participate in ordinances, learn doctrine, and be inspired, but another very important reason for attending is that, as a ward family and as disciples of the Savior Jesus Christ, we watch out for one another, encourage one another, and find ways to serve and strengthen each other. We are not just receivers and takers of what is offered at church; we are needed to be givers and suppliers. Young women and young men, next time you are at Mutual, instead of picking up your phone to see what your friends are doing, stop, look around, and ask yourself, “Who needs me today?” You may be the key to reaching out and touching the life of a peer or to giving encouragement to a friend who is quietly struggling.</p>

          <p class="question">Q: For EQ President – what are some of the things we could as members of the Elder's Quorum to help out in the ward?</p>

          <p class="verse">Another area of focus for our service can be in our ward families. Occasionally our children would ask us the question, “Why do I have to go to Mutual? I just don’t get very much out of it.”</p>

          <p class="verse">If I was having a good parenting moment, I would reply, “What makes you think you go to Mutual because of what <b>you</b> get out of it?”</p>

          <p class="question">Q: I'm sure we've all had those times where we weren't getting much out of a lesson. Is there anything you can do in those situations?</p>

          <h2 class="top-baby-buffer">Serving at Home</h2>

          <p class="verse">We live in a culture where more and more we are focused on the small, little screen in our hands than we are on the people around us. We have substituted texting and tweeting for actually looking someone in the eye and smiling or, even rarer, having a face-to-face conversation. We are often more concerned with how many followers and likes we have than with putting an arm around a friend and showing love, concern, and tangible interest. As amazing as modern technology can be for spreading the message of the gospel of Jesus Christ and helping us stay connected to family and friends, if we are not vigilant in how we use our personal devices, we too can begin to turn inward and forget that the essence of living the gospel is service.</p>

          <p class="question">Q: Why is face-to-face conversation important?</p>

          <p class="question">Q: How do you make sure your phone doesn't take you away from your family?</p>
