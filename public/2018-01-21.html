        <p><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2017/10/the-needs-before-us?lang=eng">Talk given by Sis. Bonnie Oscarson</a></p>

        <p>From talk:</p>

        <p class="verse">I have tremendous love for and faith in those of you who are in your teen and young adult years. I have seen and felt of your desires to serve and make a difference in the world. I believe that most members consider service to be at the heart of their covenants and discipleship. But I also think that sometimes it’s easy to miss some of the greatest opportunities to serve others because we are distracted or because we are looking for ambitious ways to change the world and we don’t see that some of the most significant needs we can meet are within our own families, among our friends, in our wards, and in our communities. We are touched when we see the suffering and great needs of those halfway around the world, but we may fail to see there is a person who needs our friendship sitting right next to us in class.</p>

        <p class="verse">Sister Linda K. Burton told the story of a stake Relief Society president who, working with others, collected quilts for people in need during the 1990s. “She and her daughter drove a truck filled with those quilts from London to Kosovo. On her journey home she received an unmistakable spiritual impression that sank deep into her heart. The impression was this: ‘What you have done is a very good thing. Now go home, walk across the street, and serve your neighbor!’”</p>

        <p class="question">Q: Why do you think people sometimes would prefer to help those in Africa or Kosovo, rather than focusing on those closer to home?</p>

        <hr />

        <p class="verse">What good does it do to save the world if we neglect the needs of those closest to us and those whom we love the most? How much value is there in fixing the world if the people around us are falling apart and we don’t notice? Heavenly Father may have placed those who need us closest to us, knowing that we are best suited to meet their needs.</p>

        <p class="question">Q: Why are we best suited to meet their needs?</p>

        <hr />

        <p class="verse"><b>Begin</b> your service in your own homes and within your own families. These are the relationships that can be eternal. Even if—and maybe especially if—your family situation is less than perfect, you can find ways to serve, lift, and strengthen. Begin where you are, love them as they are, and prepare for the family you want to have in the future.</p>

        <p class="question">Q: Notice how she says to <u>begin</u> your service in your home. Why might it be better to focus on serving inside your home first before serving outside of your home?</p> 

        <p class="question">Q: How do you serve your family members?</p>

        <p class="question">Q: What makes it challenging to serve more in your home?</p>

        <p>To see how we can serve those closest to us, we are going to look at how Lehi and Nephi served their family.</p>

        <hr />

        <h4>Leading</h4>

        <p><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.12?lang=eng#12">1 Nephi 8:12</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.15?lang=eng#15">1 Nephi 8:15</a> - Tree of Life</p>

        <p class="verse">12 And as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with exceedingly great joy; wherefore, I began to be desirous that my family should partake of it also; for I knew that it was desirable above all other fruit.</p>

        <p class="verse">15 And it came to pass that I beckoned unto them; and I also did say unto them with a loud voice that they should come unto me, and partake of the fruit, which was desirable above all other fruit.</p>

        <p>Lehi made the journey to the Tree of Life and tasted the fruit. And it brought him a lot of joy, to the point where he wanted to share it with his family.</p>

        <p class="question">Q: Are the Gospel and the Church like a sweet tasting fruit to you? Do you feel a deep desire to share it with your family?</p>

        <p class="question">Q: If not, how do you develop that desire?</p>

        <p class="question">Q: What's sweet about the Gospel?</p>

        <h5>Leading during tough times</h5>          

        <p><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/5.4-6?lang=eng#4">1 Nephi 5:4-6</a> - Sariah worried</p>

        <p class="verse">4 And it had come to pass that my father spake unto her, saying: I know that I am a visionary man; for if I had not seen the things of God in a vision I should not have known the goodness of God, but had tarried at Jerusalem, and had perished with my brethren.</p>

        <p class="verse">5 But behold, I have obtained a land of promise, in the which things I do rejoice; yea, and I know that the Lord will deliver my sons out of the hands of Laban, and bring them down again unto us in the wilderness.</p>

        <p class="verse">6 And after this manner of language did my father, Lehi, comfort my mother, Sariah, concerning us, while we journeyed in the wilderness up to the land of Jerusalem, to obtain the record of the Jews.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/16.23?lang=eng#23">1 Nephi 16:23</a> - Broken bow</p>

        <p class="verse">23 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did make out of wood a bow, and out of a straight stick, an arrow; wherefore, I did arm myself with a bow and an arrow, with a sling and with stones. And I said unto my father: Whither shall I go to obtain food?</p>

        <p class="question">Q: How did Nephi lead his family in this situation? How do we lead our families in moments of crisis?</p>

        <hr />

        <h4>Listening</h4>

        <p><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/15.6?lang=eng#6">1 Nephi 15:6</a> - Nephi asking</p>

        <p class="verse">6 And it came to pass that after I had received strength I spake unto my brethren, desiring to know of them the cause of their disputations.</p>
        
        <p class="question">Q: Do we take the time to ask our family members about what's going on in their lives and listen to them?</p>

        <p class="question">Q: Why is it sometimes hard to listen and respond to family members?</p>

        <hr />

        <h4>"Reproving betimes with sharpness"</h4>

        <p><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/16.1-2?lang=eng">1 Nephi 16:1-2</a> - "hard words"</p>

        <p class="verse">1 And now it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had made an end of speaking to my brethren, behold they said unto me: Thou hast declared unto us hard things, more than we are able to bear.</p>

        <p class="verse">2 And it came to pass that I said unto them that I knew that I had spoken hard things against the wicked, according to the truth; and the righteous have I justified, and testified that they should be lifted up at the last day; wherefore, the guilty taketh the truth to be hard, for it cutteth them to the very center.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/18.10?lang=eng#10">1 Nephi 18:10</a> - "exceeding rudeness"</p>

        <p class="verse">10 And I, Nephi, began to fear exceedingly lest the Lord should be angry with us, and smite us because of our iniquity, that we should be swallowed up in the depths of the sea; wherefore, I, Nephi, began to speak to them with much soberness; but behold they were angry with me, saying: We will not that our younger brother shall be a ruler over us.</p>

        <p class="question">Q: Is it hard (or easy(?)) to reprove within your family? What's the best way to go about it?</p>

        <hr />

        <h4>Being mistreated</h4>

        <p><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3.28?lang=eng#28">1 Nephi 3:28</a> - smitten with a rod</p>

        <p class="verse">28 And it came to pass that Laman was angry with me, and also with my father; and also was Lemuel, for he hearkened unto the words of Laman. Wherefore Laman and Lemuel did speak many hard words unto us, their younger brothers, and they did smite us even with a rod.</p>  

        <p><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/7.16?lang=eng#16">1 Nephi 7:16</a> - bound up</p>

        <p class="verse">16 And it came to pass that when I, Nephi, had spoken these words unto my brethren, they were angry with me. And it came to pass that they did lay their hands upon me, for behold, they were exceedingly wroth, and they did bind me with cords, for they sought to take away my life, that they might leave me in the wilderness to be devoured by wild beasts.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17.17?lang=eng#17">1 Nephi 17:17</a> - mocked</p>

        <p class="verse">17 And when my brethren saw that I was about to build a ship, they began to murmur against me, saying: Our brother is a fool, for he thinketh that he can build a ship; yea, and he also thinketh that he can cross these great waters.</p>

        <p class="question">Q: Maybe your family members haven't mistreated you the same way, but what are some of the things we suffer when we are a part of a family?</p>

        <hr />

        <h4>How did Nephi respond?</h4>

        <p><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/4.1?lang=eng">1 Nephi 4:1</a> - rod</p>

        <p class="verse">1 And it came to pass that I spake unto my brethren, saying: Let us go up again unto Jerusalem, and let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord; for behold he is mightier than all the earth, then why not mightier than Laban and his fifty, yea, or even than his tens of thousands?</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/7.20-21?lang=eng#20">1 Nephi 7:20-21</a> - bound up</p>

        <p class="verse">20 And it came to pass that they were sorrowful, because of their wickedness, insomuch that they did bow down before me, and did plead with me that I would forgive them of the thing that they had done against me.</p>

        <p class="verse">21 And it came to pass that I did frankly forgive them all that they had done, and I did exhort them that they would pray unto the Lord their God for forgiveness. And it came to pass that they did so. And after they had done praying unto the Lord we did again travel on our journey towards the tent of our father.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17.46-47?lang=eng#46">1 Nephi 17:46-47</a> - mocked</p>

        <p class="verse">46 And ye also know that by the power of his almighty word he can cause the earth that it shall pass away; yea, and ye know that by his word he can cause the rough places to be made smooth, and smooth places shall be broken up. O, then, why is it, that ye can be so hard in your hearts?</p>

        <p class="verse">47 Behold, my soul is rent with anguish because of you, and my heart is pained; I fear lest ye shall be cast off forever. Behold, I am full of the Spirit of God, insomuch that my frame has no strength.</p>

        <p class="question">Q: Obviously, Nephi responded with a lot of character. Why do you think he was able to do that?</p>

        <hr />

        <h4>Fruits of Nephi's service</h4>

        <p><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/12.1?lang=eng">1 Nephi 12:1</a></p>

        <p class="verse">1 And it came to pass that the angel said unto me: Look, and behold thy seed, and also the seed of thy brethren. And I looked and beheld the land of promise; and I beheld multitudes of people, yea, even as it were in number as many as the sand of the sea.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.6?lang=eng#5">Alma 37:6</a></p>

        <p class="verse">6 Now ye may suppose that this is foolishness in me; but behold I say unto you, that by small and simple things are great things brought to pass; and small means in many instances doth confound the wise.</p>

        <p class="question">Q: Why do you think serving our family in simple ways lead to such great outcomes?</p>

        <h2 class="top-baby-buffer">Serving at Church</h2>

        <p>From talk:</p>

        <p class="verse">It is true that we attend our weekly Church meetings to participate in ordinances, learn doctrine, and be inspired, but another very important reason for attending is that, as a ward family and as disciples of the Savior Jesus Christ, we watch out for one another, encourage one another, and find ways to serve and strengthen each other. We are not just receivers and takers of what is offered at church; we are needed to be givers and suppliers. Young women and young men, next time you are at Mutual, instead of picking up your phone to see what your friends are doing, stop, look around, and ask yourself, “Who needs me today?” You may be the key to reaching out and touching the life of a peer or to giving encouragement to a friend who is quietly struggling.</p>

        <p class="question">Q: For EQ President – what are some of the things we could as members of the Elder's Quorum to help out in the ward?</p>

        <p class="verse">Another area of focus for our service can be in our ward families. Occasionally our children would ask us the question, “Why do I have to go to Mutual? I just don’t get very much out of it.”</p>

        <p class="verse">If I was having a good parenting moment, I would reply, “What makes you think you go to Mutual because of what <b>you</b> get out of it?”</p>

        <p class="question">Q: I'm sure we've all had those times where we weren't getting much out of a lesson. Is there anything you can do in those situations?</p>

        <h2 class="top-baby-buffer">Serving at Home</h2>

        <p class="verse">We live in a culture where more and more we are focused on the small, little screen in our hands than we are on the people around us. We have substituted texting and tweeting for actually looking someone in the eye and smiling or, even rarer, having a face-to-face conversation. We are often more concerned with how many followers and likes we have than with putting an arm around a friend and showing love, concern, and tangible interest. As amazing as modern technology can be for spreading the message of the gospel of Jesus Christ and helping us stay connected to family and friends, if we are not vigilant in how we use our personal devices, we too can begin to turn inward and forget that the essence of living the gospel is service.</p>

        <p class="question">Q: Why is face-to-face conversation important?</p>

        <p class="question">Q: How do you make sure your phone doesn't take you away from your family?</p>
